// You are helping your friend, who owns a candies business, 
// with their website. Every order placed on the website gets assigned an order ID, 
// such as 1274.

// Your friend would like to create batches of five order IDs. 
// They ask you if you could give a hand and write a small program to do this.

// To complete this exercise you will have to find out:

// - how to add elements to an array with the .concat method
// - how to get the length of an array

// Declare a function addToBatch that takes two arguments, an array and a number, 
// and returns a new array by adding the number to the array.
// Now, make sure this function does not add the number if the array's length 
// is already 5 or greater â€” it should just return the array untouched in that case.
// Once your function is written, you should be able to type the following code 
// and have the exact same output:
// > addToBatch([1], 3); 
// [ 1, 3 ]

function addToBatch(array, number) {
  if (array.length >= 5) {
    return array;
  } else {
    array.push(number);
  }
  return array;
}

console.log(addToBatch([1, 2], 2));
console.log(addToBatch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 2));
console.log(addToBatch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2));
